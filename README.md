# DIY-RP2040-Board-Custom-Pi-Pico
## 👋 About The Project
This is a small, fun project I worked on during my spare time to practice PCB layout with the **RP2040** microcontroller.

I designed this board based on the official Raspberry Pi Pico reference schematic. It's essentially a "DIY Pico" – nothing too fancy, just a simple implementation to explore the RP2040 ecosystem and have some fun with Altium Designer.

## 🛠 Features
* **MCU:** RP2040 (Dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+).
* **Design:** Minimalist layout based on the official hardware design guidelines.
* **Flash:** External QSPI Flash memory (just like the original Pico).
* **USB:** Micro-USB port for power and programming.
